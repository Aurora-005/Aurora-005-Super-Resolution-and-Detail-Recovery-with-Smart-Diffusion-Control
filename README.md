# Aurora-005-Super-Resolution-and-Detail-Recovery-with-Smart-Diffusion-Control
This project presents a novel image enhancement pipeline combining, edge-preserving denoising, PID-controlled heat diffusion, and unsharp masking. The PID controller adaptively adjusts diffusion strength based on edge feedback, balancing smoothness and sharpness.
